With wisdom that emanates from God alone and inspired by the virtues of faith, and love, Consolatrix College of the Toledo City stood the test of time. The former administrators experienced this development and are determined to move forward towards excellent service to its clientele.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">This only catholic school in the city is owned and managed by the Congregation of the Augustinian Recollect Sisters since its foundation in 1960.</p>
        
        <p class="mb-4" style="text-indent: 80px">The school was founded in a very humble way as a response to the call of the church in general and to the invitation of the bishops of the archdiocese of Cebu for the religious and moral development of the youth of the Toledo City in particular. Reverend Father Leonardo Arriba, guided and inspired by his Most Rev. Julio Rosales, Archbishop of Cebu requested the Congregation to undertake the noble task of teaching
          Apostolate in the city. After the completion of the requirements given by the Bureau of Private Schools, classes stared in June 1961 with only 129 high school students with Reverend Sister Dolores de Sagrado Corazon, ARM as the first Superior Principal. The school served the community inspired by the goals to carry on the religious and moral upliftment of the youth.
